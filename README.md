# UERL

Source code for an adaptive mitigation method designed to address uncorrected errors (UEs) in DRAM. Leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, the method dynamically adapts to the probability and potential cost of encountering such errors, offering a proactive approach to mitigate their impact on computational tasks.

This is the supplemental code for the upcoming HPDC24 paper ["Reinforcement Learning-based Adaptive Mitigation of Uncorrected DRAM Errors in the Field"]() (url comming soon).

The UERL code is released under the BSD-3 [License](LICENSE).


## Code status

This repository is currently undergoing cleanup and optimization in preparation for the upcoming HPDC24 conference publication. We are actively working on improving its readability, performance, and documentation to ensure its usability for the wider community.
